# About me
I am a Computer Science Engineer from India.  
I'm passionate about computers and software especially the architecture design dealing with interplay of the various subsystems. Thus game engines fascinate me as they involve several interconnected modules that need to work together efficiently in order to provide realtime performance.  
I'm also interested in Artificial Intelligence especially Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and Causal Intelligence.
